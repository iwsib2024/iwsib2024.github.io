# Workshop History #

The software-intensive business community has emerged through different workshops that later unified within the **International Workshop on Software-intensive Business**. For example, the International Workshop on Software Ecosystems (IWSECO, 2009-2017) and the International Workshop on Software Startups (IWSS, 2015-2017), and others were created independently.

IWSiB workshop emerged at the Dagstuhl Seminar (held from April 29 to May 2, 2018) on [“Software Business, Platforms, and Ecosystems: Fundamentals of Software Production Research”](http://www.dagstuhl.de/en/program/calendar/semhp/?semnr=18182). About 30 researchers working in this area met to define the field of software-intensive business and to develop a research agenda to increase visibility and impact of software production research. As part of this process, the community decided to propose a regular workshop, ideally co-located with major software engineering conferences, to raise awareness and to continue the efforts. Since then, the workshop has became a leading avenue to entice young software business researchers into a wider software engineering community.
