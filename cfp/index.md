# Call for Papers 

&nbsp;  

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) and the resultant development of generative artificial intelligence promise profound modifications to society regarding not only economical but also social and psychological aspects. Software engineering will also be affected by the employment of these technologies to several tasks of software development. These changes will dictate but also be influenced by the business being supported by the software. The 7th International Workshop on Software-intensive Business (IWSiB) aims to bring together different research communities working on topics relevant to software-intensive business, to jointly investigate these challenges, and to bridge the gap between different research communities. The workshop is expected to spread knowledge through vivid discussions about contemporary issues and exchange information and experiences. As such, the workshop seeks to improve research contributions through swift feedback from the community, and to develop new projects between researchers and practitioners. To this end, the workshop will be a mix of research work, interactive discussions and group activities, to maximize the potential synergy among the participants from different research fields and industry.

## Submission Guidelines & Themes

IWSiB seeks submissions describing novel research and emerging ideas. We are interested in studies describing original and unpublished results in the field of software-intensive business. The focus of the workshop is on new promising ideas and therefore work-in-progress reports are welcome to ignite discussion in the workshop. The paper length should not exceed 8 pages.
Topics of interest include, but are not limited, to the following aspects of software-intensive business:

- **Software product management** (e.g., strategy, planning, pricing)
- **Software ecosystem** (e.g., engineering ecosystems, analysis of - ecosystem data, modeling of ecosystem structure and behavior, management of developer ecosystems and platforms)
- **Continuous practices** (e.g., experimentation, innovation, improvement)
- **Agile & lean projects & portfolio** (e.g., methods & practices, management and organizing, behavioral and cognitive factors)
- **Organizational management** (e.g., managing technical and social debt, integrating product and business development)
- **Software startups** (e.g., scaling, pivoting, business models)
- **Software platform** (e.g., orchestration, governance, architecture, evolution and lifecycle)
- **Software engineering economics** (e.g., in engineering of software or in the software industry)
- **Emerging trends and research areas** (e.g., remote work, deep learning, AI ethics, digital twins, management of human-AI symbiosis, etc.)

## Guidelines ##


The ICSE 2024 workshop proceedings will be prepared by IEEE CPS and
published by ACM. All workshop papers must follow the ACM formatting
instructions available at: [https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template)Papers must have a maximum length of **8 pages**. It is not possible to pay for extra pages. There is no limit on the number of submissions an author may submit, but authors are advised to focus on quality rather than on quantity.

By submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACMâ€™s new [Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/research-involving-human-participants-and-subjects). Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.

Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.

The official publication date of the workshop proceedings is
the date the proceedings are made available in the ACM Library. This
date may be up to two weeks prior to the first day of ICSE 2024. The
official publication date affects the deadline for any patent filings
related to published work.

Papers must be submitted electronically via by the defined deadline (see above) on the link: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwsib2024](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=iwsib2024)
